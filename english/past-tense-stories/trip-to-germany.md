**A Memorable Trip to Germany**

Last summer, I **decided** (/ɪd/) to take a trip to Germany. I **packed** (/t/) my bags and **boarded** (/ɪd/) a plane. When I **arrived** (/d/) in Berlin, I **felt** (/t/) excited to explore the city. I **stayed** (/d/) in a charming hotel and **started** (/ɪd/) my adventure.

On the first day, I **visited** (/ɪd/) the Brandenburg Gate and **learned** (/d/) about its history. I **walked** (/t/) through the streets and **enjoyed** (/d/) the vibrant atmosphere. In the afternoon, I **decided** (/ɪd/) to take a train to the Black Forest to experience Germany’s natural beauty.

When I **reached** (/t/) the forest, I **was** (/d/) mesmerized by the lush greenery. I **hiked** (/t/) through the trails and **noticed** (/t/) the diverse wildlife. Suddenly, I **heard** (/d/) a voice behind me.

"Hello!" a friendly woman **called** (/d/).

"Hi," I **replied** (/d/). "Isn't it beautiful here?"

"Absolutely," she **agreed** (/d/). "My name is Lena. What's yours?"

"I'm Alex," I **introduced** (/ɪd/) myself.

We **talked** (/t/) for a while and **discovered** (/d/) we had a lot in common. Lena **suggested** (/ɪd/) we explore the forest together, and I **agreed** (/d/). We **shared** (/d/) stories and **laughed** (/t/) as we **walked** (/t/).

In the evening, we **found** (/d/) a quaint little café and **ordered** (/ɪd/) some traditional German food. Over dinner, Lena **asked** (/t/) about my travels.

"So, what **brought** (/t/) you to Germany, Alex?" Lena **inquired** (/d/).

"I've always **wanted** (/ɪd/) to visit Germany," I **explained** (/d/). "I've heard so much about its rich history and beautiful landscapes. And I’m glad I **came** (/d/)."

"I'm glad you **did** (/d/), too," she **smiled** (/d/). "It's nice to meet someone who appreciates nature as much as I do."

"Do you come here often?" I **asked** (/t/).

"Yes, whenever I need a break from the city life," Lena **answered** (/d/). "The Black Forest is my escape. It's a place where I can relax and recharge."

As the night **went** (/t/) on, we **became** (/d/) more comfortable with each other. Lena **invited** (/ɪd/) me to join her for a hike the next day. I **accepted** (/ɪd/) the invitation with enthusiasm.

The next morning, we **woke** (/t/) up early and **hiked** (/t/) to a beautiful viewpoint. The sunrise **painted** (/ɪd/) the sky with stunning colors. We **sat** (/t/) together, **admired** (/d/) the view, and **talked** (/t/) about our dreams and aspirations.

"Do you have any plans after this trip?" Lena **asked** (/t/).

"Not really," I **answered** (/d/). "I might travel a bit more before heading back home. What about you?"

"I’m actually considering a career change," she **confided** (/ɪd/). "I’ve always loved nature and I’m thinking about becoming a park ranger."

"That sounds amazing!" I **exclaimed** (/d/). "You'd be great at it. You have such a passion for nature."

"Thank you," she **blushed** (/t/). "What about you? What do you do back home?"

"I'm a software developer," I **explained** (/d/). "I love creating new things and solving problems."

"That's so interesting," Lena **said** (/d/). "Maybe one day you can create something that helps people appreciate nature more."

"Maybe," I **laughed** (/t/). "It's definitely something to think about."

By the end of the trip, Lena and I **had** (/d/) formed a special connection. We **promised** (/t/) to keep in touch and **planned** (/d/) to meet again soon.

As I **left** (/t/) Germany, I **realized** (/d/) that the trip had given me more than just beautiful memories—it had also brought a wonderful person into my life.
