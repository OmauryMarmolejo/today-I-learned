Last summer, I **traveled** (/d/) to Northern Europe for an unforgettable adventure. I **arrived** (/d/) in Norway, where the air **smelled** (/d/) fresh and the scenery **looked** (/t/) stunning. On my first day, I **decided** (/ɪd/) to explore the famous fjords. I **booked** (/t/) a boat tour that **promised** (/t/) breathtaking views.

As the boat **sailed** (/d/) through the calm waters, I **noticed** (/t/) a fellow traveler, Olivia, who **seemed** (/d/) just as mesmerized as I was. We **started** (/ɪd/) talking and quickly **discovered** (/d/) our shared love for nature and adventure. She **asked** (/t/) if I **wanted** (/ɪd/) to join her on a hike the next day, and I **agreed** (/d/).

The following morning, we **hiked** (/t/) up a trail that **led** (/d/) to a hidden waterfall. The path **challenged** (/d/) us, but we **supported** (/ɪd/) each other. When we **reached** (/t/) the top, we **marveled** (/d/) at the stunning view. Olivia **suggested** (/ɪd/) we take a break and have a picnic. She **packed** (/t/) delicious snacks, and we **laughed** (/t/) and **chatted** (/ɪd/) for hours.

As the sun **set** (/t/), casting a golden glow over the landscape, Olivia **confessed** (/t/) that she **had** (/d/) a great time and **hoped** (/t/) we could meet again. I **smiled** (/d/) and **replied** (/d/) that I felt the same way. We **exchanged** (/d/) contact information and **promised** (/t/) to stay in touch.

Back in the city, we **explored** (/d/) local cafes and **visited** (/ɪd/) museums together. Each day **brought** (/t/) new experiences and **strengthened** (/d/) our bond. One afternoon, as we **strolled** (/d/) through a charming street, Olivia **pointed** (/ɪd/) to a small bookstore.

"Let's go inside," she **suggested** (/ɪd/). "I love finding unique books when I travel."

We **entered** (/d/) the cozy shop and **browsed** (/d/) the shelves. I **picked** (/t/) up a book about Norwegian folklore and **showed** (/d/) it to Olivia.

"Look at this," I **said** (/t/). "It **contains** (/z/) stories about mythical creatures."

Olivia's eyes **lit** (/t/) up. "That's fascinating! I **read** (/t/) something similar back home. Do you believe in any of these legends?"

I **laughed** (/t/). "Not really, but they're fun to read about."

We **spent** (/t/) the next hour in the bookstore, sharing our favorite finds. When we finally **left** (/t/), Olivia **clutched** (/t/) a book of poetry to her chest.

"This has been one of the best days of my trip," she **said** (/t/) softly. "Thank you for sharing it with me."

"I'm glad we **met** (/t/)," I **replied** (/d/). "You've made this trip unforgettable."

As we **walked** (/t/) back to our hotel, we **talked** (/t/) about our dreams and plans for the future. Olivia **revealed** (/d/) that she **wanted** (/ɪd/) to start a travel blog, and I **encouraged** (/d/) her to pursue it.

"You have a great eye for detail and a way with words," I **said** (/t/). "I think you'd be amazing at it."

Olivia **blushed** (/t/). "Thank you. Your support means a lot."

The next day, we **decided** (/ɪd/) to take a train to Sweden. The journey **provided** (/ɪd/) stunning views of forests and lakes. We **arrived** (/d/) in Stockholm and **explored** (/d/) the historic old town, where we **enjoyed** (/d/) local delicacies and **admired** (/d/) the architecture.

One evening, as we **sat** (/t/) by the waterfront, Olivia **looked** (/t/) at me and **smiled** (/d/).

"Do you think we would have met if you hadn't **traveled** (/d/) here?" she **asked** (/t/).

"I'd like to think so," I **answered** (/d/). "Somehow, we were meant to cross paths."

We **shared** (/d/) a comfortable silence, watching the sunset together. When it was time for me to leave, we **hugged** (/t/) and **promised** (/t/) to see each other again soon. My trip to Northern Europe **ended** (/ɪd/) with not only wonderful memories of nature but also the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

I **returned** (/d/) home feeling grateful for the adventure and looking forward to my next trip.
