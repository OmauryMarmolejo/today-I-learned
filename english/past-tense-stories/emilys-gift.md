Last weekend, Emily **decided** (/ɪd/) to organize a surprise party for her friend, Mark. She **planned** (/d/) everything meticulously. She **baked** (/t/) a cake and **decorated** (/ɪd/) the living room with balloons and streamers. She also **invited** (/ɪd/) all their mutual friends.

On the day of the party, Emily **cooked** (/t/) Mark's favorite dishes. She **prepared** (/d/) lasagna, salad, and garlic bread. She also **mixed** (/t/) a special punch. While she **waited** (/ɪd/) for the guests to arrive, she **arranged** (/d/) the food on the table and **cleaned** (/d/) the house.

When Mark **arrived** (/d/), he **looked** (/t/) surprised (/t/) and thrilled. He **thanked** (/t/) Emily for her effort. They **chatted** (/ɪd/) and **laughed** (/t/) with their friends. Everyone **enjoyed** (/d/) the food and **praised** (/t/) Emily’s cooking skills. They **danced** (/t/) and **played** (/d/) games until late in the night.

By the end of the party, Emily **felt** (/t/) exhausted but happy. She **realized** (/d/) that all the hard work had been worth it. She **hugged** (/d/) Mark and **promised** (/t/) to make this an annual tradition. As she **reflected** (/ɪd/) on the day, she **smiled** (/d/), feeling content and fulfilled.
