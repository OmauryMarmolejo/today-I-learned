Last summer, I **traveled** (/d/) to Germany for a vacation. I **booked** (/t/) a cozy little cabin in the Black Forest. As soon as I **arrived** (/d/), I **noticed** (/t/) the fresh air and the beautiful scenery. I **unpacked** (/t/) my bags and **decided** (/ɪd/) to explore the area.

On the first day, I **walked** (/t/) through the forest and **spotted** (/ɪd/) a charming café. I **entered** (/d/) and **ordered** (/d/) a coffee. While I **waited** (/ɪd/) for my drink, I **started** (/ɪd/) a conversation with a local named Anna. She **smiled** (/d/) warmly and **invited** (/ɪd/) me to join her at her table. We **chatted** (/ɪd/) for hours, and I **realized** (/d/) how much we had in common.

The next day, Anna **suggested** (/ɪd/) that we go hiking together. We **climbed** (/d/) a steep hill and **reached** (/t/) the top just as the sun **started** (/ɪd/) to set. The view **took** (/t/) my breath away. Anna **laughed** (/t/) when she **noticed** (/t/) how stunned I **looked** (/t/). She **pointed** (/ɪd/) out different landmarks and **explained** (/d/) their history.

Later that evening, we **returned** (/d/) to the cabin and **cooked** (/t/) dinner together. We **talked** (/t/) about our dreams and **shared** (/d/) stories from our lives. I **felt** (/t/) a connection I had never **experienced** (/t/) before.

On my last day, Anna and I **visited** (/ɪd/) a beautiful lake. We **rented** (/ɪd/) a boat and **paddled** (/ɪd/) to the center. As we **floated** (/ɪd/) on the calm water, I **took** (/t/) her hand and **asked** (/t/) if she would like to stay in touch. She **agreed** (/d/) and **promised** (/t/) to visit me in my home country soon.

When I **returned** (/d/) home, I **felt** (/t/) grateful for the amazing trip and the wonderful person I had **met** (/t/). That trip to Germany **changed** (/d/) my life in ways I had never **expected** (/ɪd/).
