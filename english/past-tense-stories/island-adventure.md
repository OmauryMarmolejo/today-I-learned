Last summer, a group of friends **decided** (/ɪd/) to go on an adventure. They **planned** (/d/) a trip to a mysterious island that they **had** (/d/) heard about for years. They **packed** (/t/) their bags and **boarded** (/ɪd/) a small boat early in the morning.

As they **sailed** (/d/) across the ocean, they **spotted** (/ɪd/) dolphins swimming alongside. The sight **amazed** (/d/) them, and they **cheered** (/d/) loudly. After a few hours, they **arrived** (/d/) at the island and **anchored** (/d/) the boat near the shore.

They **explored** (/d/) the beach and **found** (/d/) an old map buried in the sand. The map **showed** (/d/) the way to a hidden treasure. Excitedly, they **followed** (/d/) the map's directions and **trekked** (/t/) through the dense jungle.

Along the way, they **encountered** (/ɪd/) various animals and **observed** (/d/) the vibrant wildlife. They **noticed** (/t/) unusual plants and **collected** (/ɪd/) samples to study later. Suddenly, they **heard** (/d/) a rustling sound and **realized** (/d/) they were not alone. A group of explorers **emerged** (/d/) from the bushes and **introduced** (/ɪd/) themselves.

The new group **explained** (/d/) that they too **had** (/d/) found the same map and **were** (/d/) on the same quest. They **decided** (/ɪd/) to join forces and **searched** (/t/) for the treasure together. After hours of searching, they **discovered** (/d/) a hidden cave.

Inside the cave, they **uncovered** (/d/) a chest filled with gold coins and jewels. They **celebrated** (/ɪd/) their find and **agreed** (/d/) to share the treasure. As the sun **set** (/d/), they **returned** (/d/) to their boat, feeling fulfilled and excited about their adventure.

They **shared** (/d/) stories and **laughed** (/t/) all the way back, cherishing the memories they **had** (/d/) created. It **was** (/d/) a day they **would** (/d/) never forget.
