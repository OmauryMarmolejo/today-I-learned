Brian had a secret. He always hid his cigarettes in the old, creaky chest in the attic, just in case his mom went snooping around. One rainy afternoon, he heard a loud thump from upstairs. "Could you please speak more slowly?" his little sister, Emily, asked as he rushed past her. "What's going on?"

I don't know, but I'm going to find out, Brian replied, his heart pounding in his chest. He turned the corner and dashed up the stairs, his mind racing with possibilities.

When he reached the attic, he saw that the old chest was open. His eyes widened as he started at the peculiar sight before him. A chicken, yes, a chicken, was strutting around with something shiny in its beak. "What on earth?" Brian muttered. He remembered Kyle's ridiculous tattoo of a chicken on his chest and almost laughed at the coincidence.

Briam swam through the sea of old clothes and dusty books towards the chest. He needed to see what was inside. As he leaned in closer, he saw the key, which always turned to the left, not to the right, was now lying beside the open chest.

"Margaret flew to Boston yesterday," he thought to himself, so it ca't be her playing tricks on me." Suddenly he felt a shar pain in his wrist. "ouch" he yelped, as he locked down to see the chicken pecking at him.

Ignoring the pain, he stared at the ceiling, trying to make sense of it all. The ceiling of the attic had always been plain, but now it was covered in strange symbols. "What is happening?" he whispered, feeling a chill run down his spine.

He stared at the chest again. This time, he noticed a dusty old book inside. As he picked it up, he dreamt he was a horse and could fly, soaring above the clouds. Shaking his head to clear the strange vision he flipped through the pages.

"While you're shopping can you please but some eggs?" Emily's voice called from downstairs, snapping him back to reality. "Yeah, sure!" he shouted back, his eyes still glued to the book. He had a feeling this book was the key to the mystery.

As he moved towards the door, the chicken flew up and perched on his shoulder. "Alright, buddy, let's solve this together". Brian said feeling a strange bond with the bird.

Which a deep breath, he closed the attic door behind him, ready for whatever adventure lay ahead.
