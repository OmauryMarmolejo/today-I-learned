I neet to generate 3 separate markdown elements:

1. A table of words and their meanings. The table should have these headers:

| Word | Meaning | Example 1 | Example 2 |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | --------- |

2. A separate table of phrases. Please include in this table all the entries that have in parenthesis "(phrasal verb)", "(phrase)" and "(idiom)"

3. A list with just the elements of the column "Word" from the table of words and meanings.
