# The Passive with Modals - Modals in the present passive

The modal verbs are used to express ability, possibility, permission, or obligation. They are used with the base form of the verb:

- can
- could
- may
- Note: **may** is used to express a possibility that is more likely than **might**.
- might
  - Note: **might** is used to express a possibility that is less likely than **may**.
- must
  - Note: **must** is used to express a strong sense of duty or obligation.
- shall
- should
- will
- would
- ought to
  - Note: **ought to** is used to express a stronger sense of duty or obligation than **should**.

Modals verbs in English can be used in passive forms. As with other passive constructions, the emphasis changes to the object that receives the action.

Modals in the passive form don't change. The sentence starts with the modal, then the verb "be" plus the past participle of the main verb.

## How to form

Subject + **modal verb** + **be** + **past participle** + rest of sentence
