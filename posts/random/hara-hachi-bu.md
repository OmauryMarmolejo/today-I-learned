Most of the times we eat because of social pressure, boredom, anxiety, even because we have the habit of eating at certain times. Hara hachi bu remains us the importance of eating when you are legitimately hungry because that allow you to be more conscious and in touch with your sensations. It also helps you to be more present and enjoy the food more.

Another key aspect of hara hachi bu is to be present and eat slowly, this way you give time to your body to send the signal to your brain that you are full. This is important because it takes around 20 minutes for your brain to receive the signal that you are full.
