# Simple Past vs Present Perfect

## Simple Past

The simple past is used to describe an action that started and finished at a specific time in the past. It is used to describe a completed action in a time before now.

- I saw a movie yesterday.
- I didn't see a play yesterday.
- Last year, I traveled to Japan.
- Last summer, I stayed at a hotel in New York.
- I finished my work then I went to bed.
- Did you see a movie yesterday?
- Did you see him in the morning?

## Present Perfect

When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with the present. We are talking about something that happened in the past but there is a connection to now.

- I have seen that movie twenty times.
- I think I have met him once before.
- There have been many earthquakes in California.
- People have traveled to the moon.
- I have already finished my homework.
- I haven't seen him today.
- Have you seen a movie in this week?
- Have you seen him in the morning?
- I have never traveled to Japan.

## Quick guide to choosing between the present perfect and simple past

- Use simple past when you need to use specific time. Ex: yesterday, last year, in 1999, 2 minutes ago.
- Use present perfect when you don't need to use specific time.
- Use present perfect when you have words reference like yet, already, never, ever, before.
