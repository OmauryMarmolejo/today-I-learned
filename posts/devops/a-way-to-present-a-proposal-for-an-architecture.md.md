# A way to present a proposal for an architecture

This guide provides a template for presenting a proposal for an architecture. It is intended to be used by engineers, architects, and other technical roles to communicate their ideas effectively.
The following manual consider the following steps:

- Introduction: A brief introduction to the proposal. Including the reasons and benefits of the architecture.
- Target Architecture Overview: A description of the target architecture. Including the benefits of the architecture. It should include the target infrastructure diagram.
- Implementation Plan: A detailed plan for implementing the architecture.
- Timeline and Effort Estimation: A timeline and effort estimation for implementing the architecture.
- Cost Estimation: A cost estimation for implementing the architecture.

## Example

### Introduction

Our application is currently running on a single server. This architecture has several limitations, including scalability, availability, and security. To address these limitations, we propose a new architecture that leverages cloud services to provide a scalable, highly available, and secure environment for our application.

### Target Architecture Overview

We propose to move our application to a cloud-based architecture that leverages AWS services. The new architecture will consist of the following components:

- A ECS cluster to run our application containers.
- A load balancer to distribute traffic to the ECS cluster.
- A RDS cluster to store our application data.
- A VPC to isolate our application resources.
- A CloudFront distribution to cache static assets and improve performance.
- A WAF to protect our application from common web attacks.
- A CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the health of our application.
- A Route 53 hosted zone to manage our application's DNS records.
- A S3 bucket to store our application logs.

The benefits of this architecture include:

- Scalability: The new architecture will allow us to scale our application horizontally by adding more ECS instances.
- Availability: The new architecture will be highly available, with multiple ECS instances running in different availability zones.
- Security: The new architecture will be more secure, with a WAF protecting our application from common web attacks.
- Performance: The new architecture will improve the performance of our application by caching static assets with CloudFront.
- Monitoring: The new architecture will provide better monitoring of our application's health with CloudWatch.
- Cost: The new architecture will be cost-effective, with pay-as-you-go pricing for the AWS services.

### Implementation Plan

The implementation plan for the new architecture is as follows:

- Set up the ECS cluster and load balancer.
- Set up the RDS cluster and VPC.
- Set up the CloudFront distribution and WAF.
- Set up the CloudWatch dashboard and Route 53 hosted zone.
- Set up the S3 bucket for application logs.
- Migrate the application to the new architecture.
- Test the new architecture.
- Monitor the new architecture.
- Optimize the new architecture.
- Document the new architecture.
- Train the team on the new architecture.
- Go live with the new architecture.
- Monitor the new architecture post-launch.

#### Set up the ECS cluster and load balancer

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Create the ECS cluster.
  - Create the load balancer.
  - Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic to the ECS cluster.

#### Set up the RDS cluster and VPC

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Create the RDS cluster.
  - Create the VPC.
  - Configure the RDS cluster to use the VPC.

#### Set up the CloudFront distribution and WAF

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Create the CloudFront distribution.
  - Create the WAF.
  - Configure the WAF to protect the CloudFront distribution.

#### Set up the CloudWatch dashboard and Route 53 hosted zone

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Create the CloudWatch dashboard.
  - Create the Route 53 hosted zone.
  - Configure the Route 53 hosted zone to manage the application's DNS records.

#### Set up the S3 bucket for application logs

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Create the S3 bucket.
  - Configure the application to log to the S3 bucket.

#### Migrate the application to the new architecture

- Time: 2 weeks
- Tasks:
  - Migrate the application code to run in ECS containers.
  - Migrate the application data to the RDS cluster.

#### Test the new architecture

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Test the application in the new architecture.
  - Perform load testing on the new architecture.

#### Monitor the new architecture

- Time: Ongoing
- Tasks:
  - Monitor the health of the ECS cluster.
  - Monitor the performance of the RDS cluster.
  - Monitor the security of the WAF.

#### Optimize the new architecture

- Time: Ongoing
- Tasks:
  - Optimize the ECS cluster for performance.
  - Optimize the RDS cluster for cost.

#### Document the new architecture

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Document the new architecture.
  - Create diagrams of the new architecture.

#### Train the team on the new architecture

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Train the team on the new architecture.
  - Provide documentation and resources for the team to reference.

#### Go live with the new architecture

- Time: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Deploy the new architecture to production.
  - Monitor the new architecture post-launch.

#### Monitor the new architecture post-launch

- Time: Ongoing
- Tasks:
  - Monitor the performance of the new architecture.
  - Monitor the security of the new architecture.
  - Monitor the cost of the new architecture.

### Timeline and Effort Estimation

Considering the tasks and time estimation for each task, we estimate the total effort required to implement the new architecture to be 12 weeks. This includes 10 weeks of implementation and 2 weeks of testing and optimization.

### Cost Estimation

Based on the AWS pricing for the services we plan to use, we estimate the cost of implementing the new architecture to be $500 per month. This includes the cost of the ECS cluster, RDS cluster, CloudFront distribution, WAF, CloudWatch dashboard, Route 53 hosted zone, and S3 bucket.

## Conclusion

This idea is simply a template to present a proposal for an architecture. It is important to adapt it to the specific needs of the project and the organization. The goal is to communicate the benefits and implementation plan of the proposed architecture effectively. It's important to consider the addition or removal of sections based on the project requirements.
